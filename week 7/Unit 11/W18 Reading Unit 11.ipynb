    "- Numpy sits as the foundation of the Python Data Packages\n",
    "    - it has low level machinery that can make data crunching efficient \n",
    "    - But it would be a ton of work to perform a full data analysis using numpy arrays.\n",
    "        - you'd end up having to write procedures for common tasks from scratch \n",
    "- Pandas is a separate package that addresses this gap.\n",
    "     - it takes the power of numpy, but wraps it up in a suer-friendly package\n",
    "     - give us higer level tools to do the things we commonly do with data.\n",
    "     - a lot of the syntac is inspired by R, a very data-oriented panguage \n",
    "         - emphasizes functional programming, very clean and explict code.\n",
    "- several core types\n",
    "    - index \n",
    "        - how you label the data, access different observations \n",
    "    - series \n",
    "        - a single column of data \n",
    "        - has an index \n",

    "        - this is the usual way we represent a dataset\n",
    "            - each column becomes a variable \n",
    "            - each row is an observation of a unit of analysis \n",

    "- the key to pandas\n",
    "    - sits on top of NumPy so it is fast and efficient \n",
